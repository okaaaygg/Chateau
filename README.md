# Chateau
A Discord bot that allows users to make their own temporary public/private voice channels.
#### *Bot written with the help of [Discord.py](http://discordpy.rtfd.org/en/latest)**

### **This bot is under development & is not currently ready to be downloaded & used. I will be updating it regularly & I will announce when it is officially released.**
### I am currently working on other, larger projects. This bot was written months ago and I have improved my programming skills tremendously since then. I will be rewriting this bot as soon as I finish my current projects.
